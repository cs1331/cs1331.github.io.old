# CS 1331 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming - Fall 2015

## Instructors

* Dave Lillethun, davel@gatech.edu

**IMPORTANT**: Include [CS1331] in the subject of your course-related email. For example, Subject: [CS1331] Exam 2 Question. Professors are deluged with email. If we don't respond, don't take it personally. Just resend your email with a friendly reminder.

## Course Description

CS 1331 teaches students how to develop object-oriented solutions to computational problems. Students learn basic object-oriented design principles, further develop the programming skills learned in previous courses, write medium-sized object-oriented programs in a modern programming language, and -- as the first course required for computer science majors and minors -- get a deeper introduction to the field of computer science.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to:

* describe the elements of structured programming and analyze the behavior of structured computer programs;
* demonstrate the elements of structured programming in working computer programs;
* define the basic principles of static typing and apply them in the analysis and creation of computer programs;
* define object-oriented programming principles and demonstrate them by creating programs that apply these principles;
* create Java programs with up to 12 classes/interfaces, 10 soruce files, and 500 lines of code;
* describe event-driven programming principles and apply them in graphical user interface (GUI) programs;
* describe basic algorithms and data structures and implement them in computer programs; and
* select the most appropriate basic algorithms and data structures for a given programming problem.

## Requirements

### Grading

* Homeworks: 20%
* Programming Quizzes: 20%
* Exams: 40%
* Final Exam: 20%

Grade Cutoffs: A: 90, B: 80, C: 70, D: 60


### Assignments

Bi-weekly homework programming assignments, bi-weekly in-class programming quizzes, two in-class written exams, and an in-class written final exam.

#### Academic Integrity and Collaboration

We expect academic honor and integrity from students. Please study and follow the academic honor code of Georgia Tech: <a href="http://www.policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/code-conduct" target="_blank">http://www.policylibrary.gatech.edu/student-affairs/code-conduct</a>. You may collaborate on homework assignments, but your submissions must be your own. You may not collaborate on in-class programming quizzes or exams.

#### Due Dates, Late Work, and Missed Work

* Programming assignments are submitted via Georiga Tech's private GitHub (http://github.gatech.edu). Programming quizzes are due by the end of class. Homework assignments are due at 23:59 on the due date. Multiple resubmissions are allowed, so submit early and often so you aren't in a rush on the due date. Late submissions receive a 0.

* There are no makeup exams. Exceptions are only considered under special circumstances such as serious illness, hospitalization, death in the family, judicial procedures, military service, or official school functions. Provide us with a copy of your letter from the registrar in advance for official school functions. For other excused absences you must provide documentation to the Dean of Students **within one week of your return from illness/activity**. The Dean of Students will verifiy your excuse and send us a notice. Excusal from coursework or make-up opportunities are granted at the sole discretion of your instructor.

#### Grade contest

To contest any grade you must submit an official regrade form to the Head TA **within one week of the assignment's original return date**. The original return date is the date the exam was first made available for students to pick up or the grade was posted online in the case of homework assignments and programming quizzes.

### Class Participation

Lecture and workshop/recitation attendance is required and assumed.

## Course Outline

* Week 1 - Week 5: Element of Programming in Java (values, variables, control structures, classes)
