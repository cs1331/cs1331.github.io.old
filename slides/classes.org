** Anatomy of a Class

By the end of next lecture, you'll understand everything in this class definition.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
package edu.gatech.cs1331.card;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Card {

  public static final String[] VALID_RANKS = {"2", ... , "ace"};
  public static final String[] VALID_SUITS = {"diamonds", ... };
  private String rank;
  private String suit;

  public Card(String aRank, String aSuit) {
    // ...
  }
  public String toString() {
    return rank + " of " + suit;
  }
  private boolean isValidRank(String someRank) { ... }
}
#+END_SRC

** The Card Class Example

In this lecture we'll use a running example stored in a Git repo. Go to [[https://github.com/cs1331/card][https://github.com/cs1331/card]], click on "Clone or download" and copy the clone URL. Then open your terminal and do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd cs1331
git clone https://github.com/cs1331/card.git
cd card
#+END_SRC

Note that if you've uplaoded your public SSH key you may use an SSH clone URL.

Now you're ready to follow along. Start by checking out v0.0 [fn:1]:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout v0.0
#+END_SRC

[fn:1] [[http://semver.org/][Semantic Versioning]]

** A Card Class, v0.0

Consider how to represent a Card ADT:

- rank - the rank of a playing card, e.g., 2, jack, ace
- suit - the suit of a playing card, e.g., spades, diamonds

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {

    String rank;
    String suit;
}
#+END_SRC

-  ~rank~  and  ~suit~  are instance variables
- Every *instance* of  ~Card~  has its own copy of instance variables.

Let's "do something" with  ~Card~  by adding a main method and bumping to v0.1.


**  ~Card~  v0.1

After
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout v0.1
#+END_SRC

we have (we won't include the git commands in future slides):

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {

    String rank;
    String suit;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Note that we can put a  ~main~  method in any class. This is useful for exploratory testing, like we're doing here.

The  ~String~  representation isn't very appealing.  (What does it print?)

**  ~Card~  v0.2


#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    String rank;
    String suit;

    public String toString() {
        return rank + " of " + suit;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card swedishPop = new Card();
        swedishPop.rank = "ace";
        swedishPop.suit = "base";
        Card handy = new Card();
        handy.rank = "jack";
        handy.suit = "all trades";
        System.out.println(swedishPop);
        System.out.println(handy);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Now we have a nice  ~String~  representation, but we havve an "ace of base" card and a "jack of all trades", which aren't valid cards.

** Encapsulation: Card, v1.0

Let's protect the instance variables by making them private:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    private String rank;
    private String suit;

    public String toString() {
        return rank + " of " + suit;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        c.rank = "ace";
        c.suit = "base";
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Why does this still compile?

-  ~main~  method in  ~Card~  -- can see  ~Card~ 's private parts


** A Dealer Class, v1.1

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        c.rank = "ace";
        c.suit = "base";
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

This won't compile (which is what we want). Why?

** Mutators: Card, v1.2

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {

    private String rank;
    private String suit;

    public void setRank(String rank) {
        rank = rank;
    }
    public void setSuit(String suit) {
        suit = suit;
    }
}
#+END_SRC

- Now client code can set the rank and suit of a card by calling  ~setRank~  and  ~setSuit~ .
-  ~setX~  is the Java convention for a setter method for an instance variable named  ~x~ .

** Dealing  ~Card~ , v1.2

Let's try out our new  ~Card~  class.
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        c.setRank("ace");
        c.setSuit("base");
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Oops.  Prints "null of null".  Why?

** Shadowing Variables

The parameters in the setters "shadowed" the instance variables:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public void setRank(String rank) {
    rank = rank;
}

public void setSuit(String suit) {
    suit = suit;
}
#+END_SRC

-  ~rank~  in  ~setRank~  refers to the local  ~rank~  variable, not the instance variable of the same name
-  ~suit~  in  ~setSuit~  refers to the local  ~suit~  variable, not the instance variable of the same name

** Dealing with  ~this~ : Card, v1.2.1

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    private String rank;
    private String suit;

    public void setRank(String rank) {
        this.rank = rank;
    }
    public void setSuit(String suit) {
        this.suit = suit;
    }
}
#+END_SRC

- Every instance of a class has a  ~this~  reference which refers to the instance on which a method is being called.
-  ~this.rank~  refers to the  ~rank~  instance variable for the  ~Card~  instance on which  ~setRank~  is being called.
-  ~this.rank~  is different from the local  ~rank~  variable that is a parameter to the  ~setRank~  method.

** Dealing  ~Card~ , v1.2.1


#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        c.setRank("ace");
        c.setSuit("base");
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Now we have encapsulation, but we can still create invalid  ~Card~ s, e.g., "base" is not a valid suit.  How to fix?

** Class Invariants

Class invariant: a condition that must hold for all instances of a class in order for instances of the class to be considered valid.

Invariants for Card class:

-  ~rank~  must be one of {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
         "10", "jack", "queen", "king", "ace"}
-  ~suit~  must be one of {"diamonds", "clubs", "hearts","spades"}

** Class Invariants: Card v1.3

 ~rank~  invariant can be maintained by adding:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    private final String[] VALID_RANKS =
        {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
         "10", "jack", "queen", "king", "ace"};
    public void setRank(String rank) {
        if (!isValidRank(rank)) {
            System.out.println(rank + " is not a valid rank.");
            System.exit(0);
        }
        this.rank = rank;
    }
    private boolean isValidRank(String someRank) {
        return contains(VALID_RANKS, someRank);
    }
    private boolean contains(String[] array, String item) {
        for (String element: array) {
            if (element.equals(item)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    // ...
}
#+END_SRC

** Class Invariants Ensure Consistent Objects

Now we can't write code that instantiates an invalid  ~Card~  object:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        c.setRank("ace");
        c.setSuit("base");
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

yields:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ java Dealer
base is not a valid suit.
#+END_SRC

**  ~Dealer~  v1.3.1

Version 1.3.1 fixes the invalid suit:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        c.setRank("ace");
        c.setSuit("spades");
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

** Initializing Instances (v1.4)

 ~Card~  now ensures that we don't create card objects with invalid ranks or suits.
But consider this slight modification to  ~Dealer~  in v1.4:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer5 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        System.out.println(c); // Printing a new Card instance
        c.setRank("ace");
        c.setSuit("base");
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

What if we printed our  ~Card~  instance,  ~c~ , before we called the setters?

** Object Initialization


Two ways to initialize the instance variables of an object:

- Declaration point initialization:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    private String rank = "2";
    // ...
}
#+END_SRC

- Constructors

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    public Card() {
      rank = "2";
    }
    // ...
}
#+END_SRC

A constructor is what's being called when you invoke operator  ~new~ .

** Initializing Objects

Since we didn't write our own constructor, Java provided a default no-arg constructor
- default no-arg ctor sets instance variables (that don't have their own declaration-point intializations) to their default values.

That's why a ~Card~  object's instance variables are ~null~ (" ~null of null~ ") after they're instantiated.  We have to call the setters on a  ~Card~  instance before we have a valid object.

** Innitialization Style

In general, it's poor style to require multi-step initialization.

- After  ~new Card()~  is called, instance variables have useless defaults.
- Client programmer must remember to call setter methods.
- Often there can be order dependencies that we don't want to burden client programmers with.

The way to fix this is by writing our own constructor.

** A Constructor for Card, v2.0

If we write a constructor, Java won't provide a default no-arg constructor.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    // ...
    public Card(String rank, String suit) {
        setRank(rank);
        setSuit(suit);
    }
    // ...
}
#+END_SRC

If we want a no-arg constructor in addition to other constructors, we must write it explicitly.

**  ~Dealer~  v2.0

Now this won't even compile:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card();
        // ...
    }
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ javac Dealer.java
Dealer.java:4: error: constructor Card in class Card cannot be applied to given types;
        Card c = new Card();
                 ^
  required: String,String
  found: no arguments
  reason: actual and formal argument lists differ in length
1 error
#+END_SRC

** Using the Card v2.0.1 Constructor

Now we have a safer, more consistent  way to initialize objects:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card("queen", "hearts");
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

** Progress Check

Let's review our progress with our Card class design:

- We have a nice string representation of Card objects.
- We have encapsulated the rank and suit in private instance variables with mutator methods to set their values.
- We validate the rank and suit in the mutator methods so we can't set invalid ranks and suits in Card objects.
-  ~Card~  has a constructor, which ensures that instance variables are initialized when an instance of  ~Card~  is created.

** Valid Ranks and Suits

Recall the declarations and definitions of our ~VALID_RANKS~ and ~VALID_SUITS~ :

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public final String[] VALID_RANKS =
    {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
     "10", "jack", "queen", "king", "ace"};

public final String[] VALID_SUITS =
    {"diamonds", "clubs", "hearts","spades"};
#+END_SRC

Do we need a separate instance of  ~VALID_RANKS~  and  ~VALID_SUITS~  for each instance of our Card class?

** Static Members, Card v2.1

 ~static~  members are shared with all instances of a class:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public static final String[] VALID_RANKS =
    {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9",
     "10", "jack", "queen", "king", "ace"};
public static final String[] VALID_SUITS =
    {"diamonds", "clubs", "hearts","spades"};
#+END_SRC

Given the declarations above:

- Each instance shares a single copy of  ~VALID_RANKS~  and a single copy of  ~VALID_SUITS~
- Since they're  ~final~ , we can safely make them  ~public~  so clients of our Card class can use them

** Stateful ~Card~ Objects?

 ~Card~  v2.1 is pretty good, but we can write code like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Dealer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Card c = new Card("queen", "hearts");
        System.out.println(c);
        c.setRank("jack"); // modifying c
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Does this make sense?  Should Card objects be mutable?

** Immutable Objects

Card objects don't change.  We can model this behavior by removing the setters and putting the initialization code in the constructor (or making the setters private and calling them from the constructor):

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public Card(String aRank, String aSuit) { // constructor
  if (!isValidRank(rank)) {
    System.out.println(aRank + " is not a valid rank.");
    System.exit(0);
  }
  rank = aRank;
  if (!isValidSuit(aSuit)) {
    System.out.println(aSuit + " is not a valid suit.");
    System.exit(0);
  }
  suit = aSuit;
}
#+END_SRC

Note the use of another idiom for disambiguating constructor paramters from instance variables (as opposed to using  ~this~ ).


# ** Designing Immutable Classes

# An immutable class is a class whose instances cannot be modified.  To make a class immutable:

# - Don't provide mutator methods ("setters")
# - Make the class  ~final~  so it can't be extended (there's another way to accomplish this, but making the class  ~final~  is good enough for now)
# - Make all fields  ~final~
# - Make all fields  ~private~
# - For fields of mutable class types, return defensive copies in accessor methods (we'll discuss this later)

# ** Prefer Immutable Classes

# In general, make your classes immutable unless you have a good reason to make them mutable.  Why?  Because immutable objects

# - are simpler to design because you don't have to worry about enforcing class invariants in multiple places,
# - are easier to reason about because the state of an object never changes after instantiation,
# - are inherently thread-safe because access to mutable data need not be syncronized, and
# - enable safe instance sharing, so redundant copies need not be created.

** A Few Final Bits of Polish

Take a look at the final evolution of our Card class.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git checkout master
#+END_SRC

It contains a few more enhancements:

- It has an  ~equals()~ method for comparing cards of equal value.
  - We'll learn the role of the ~equals~ method today and learn how to write one in a couple of weeks.
- It uses ~enum~ s for rank and suit.

** Enums

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public enum Rank {
    TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public enum Rank {
    TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE
}
#+END_SRC

Now we get static type checking for ~Rank~ and ~Suit~ -- no need for run-time validity checks.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {

    private Rank rank;
    private Suit suit;

    public Card(Rank aRank, Suit aSuit) {
        rank = aRank;
        suit = aSuit;
    }
...
}
#+END_SRC

** Equality

- For reference types:
  -  ~==~  means identity equality (aliasing testing).
  - ~equals(Object)~  tests value equality, as defined by the class.

- For primitive types ~==~ means value equality and is the only equality test.

Here's the final ~Card~ class, with a definition of value equality for ~Card~ instances:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Card {
    private Rank rank;
    private Suit suit;
    public Card(Rank aRank, Suit aSuit) {
        rank = aRank;
        suit = aSuit;
    }
    public String toString() { return rank + " of " + suit; }

    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        if (null == other) { return false; }
        if (this == other) { return true; }
        if (!(other instanceof Card)) { return false; }
        Card that = (Card) other;
        return this.rank.equals(that.rank) && this.suit.equals(that.suit);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

** Equality Tests

Given our finished Card class with a properly implemented  ~equals(Object)~  method, this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
Card c1 = new Card(Rank.ACE, Suit.SPADES);
Card c2 = new Card(Rank.ACE, Suit.SPADES);
Card c3 = c1;
System.out.println("c1 == c2 returns " + (c1 == c2));
System.out.println("c1.equals(c2) returns " + c1.equals(c2));
System.out.println("c1 == c3 returns " + (c1 == c3));
System.out.println("c1.equals(c3) returns " + c1.equals(c3));
#+END_SRC

produces this output:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  c1 == c2 returns false
  c1.equals(c2) returns true
  c1 == c3 returns true
  c1.equals(c3) returns true
#+END_SRC

By the way, what if we left off the parentheses around  ~c1 == c2~  in   ~System.out.println("c1 == c2 returns " + (c1 == c2))~ ?

** Exercise: Treating People as Objects

Using the encapsulation techniques we just learned, write a class named  ~Person~  with a  ~name~  field of type  ~String~  and an  ~age~  field of type  ~int~ .

Write a suitable  ~toString~  method for your   ~Person~  class.

Add a main method that:

- Creates an array of  ~Person~  objects
- Iterates through the array and prints each Person object who's age is greater than 21
